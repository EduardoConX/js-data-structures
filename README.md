This repository provides clear, well-tested implementations of the most common data structures using TypeScript as the source of truth. All structures compile to JavaScript and include generated type definitions, making the library fully compatible with both JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

The goal is to offer simple, reusable building blocks for learning algorithms, solving coding challenges, and building performant applications.
